<h1>Privacy Policy - Floating Time Tracker</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 07/12/2025</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>HealthierTime</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information
    when you use the mobile application <strong>Floating Time Tracker</strong> (“the App”).
</p>

<p>
    Floating Time Tracker is a digital wellbeing tool that helps you understand how much time you spend using your device
    and your apps. All processing is done on your device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or sell your data
    to any server or third party.
</p>

<h2>Minimum Age Requirement</h2>

<p>
    You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use Floating Time Tracker.
    The App is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>Information We Process</h2>

<h3>1. Device Usage Time (Screen-On Time)</h3>

<p>
    The App measures how long your device is in use by counting seconds while the device is powered on.
    This includes time when your phone is on and locked, and when it is on and unlocked.
</p>

<p>The App:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Does record</strong> time when the device is powered on (locked or unlocked).</li>
    <li><strong>Does not record</strong> time when the device is powered off.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This information is used only to show:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your daily usage time (e.g. “Today”).</li>
    <li>Your lifetime accumulated usage time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This data is stored locally on your device in the App’s private storage.
</p>

<h3>2. App Usage Statistics (Foreground App Tracking)</h3>

<p>
    With your permission, the App uses the Android Usage Access API (<code>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</code>) to see which
    application is currently in the foreground and for how long it stays there.
</p>

<p>Specifically, the App can access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Application package names (e.g. <code>com.example.app</code>).</li>
    <li>How long each app has been in the foreground while the screen is on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The App <strong>cannot</strong> and <strong>does not</strong> access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Message content, photos, videos, or files.</li>
    <li>Passwords, keystrokes, or input.</li>
    <li>Browsing content or in-app data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Per-app usage is only recorded while the device screen is on.
    This information is used to build the usage table, usage graphs (over ranges such as 7 days to 3 years),
    and optional CSV exports.
</p>

<p>
    All app usage statistics remain on your device and are never sent to HealthierTime or to any third party.
</p>

<h3>3. Overlay Permission (“Appear on Top”)</h3>

<p>
    The App can show a small floating bubble over other apps to display your active usage time.
    This feature requires the system “Appear on top” permission (<code>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</code>).
</p>

<p>The floating bubble:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Displays only the timer text.</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> read or capture what is shown in other apps.</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> intercept keystrokes, input, or personal content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Foreground Service</h3>

<p>
    Floating Time Tracker uses a foreground service to keep the timer and app usage tracking accurate while the device is on.
</p>

<p>The foreground service:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Runs locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Does not access network data.</li>
    <li>Does not send information to any server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. CSV Export</h3>

<p>
    The App allows you to export your usage history to a CSV file.
</p>

<p>When you use this feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The export happens only if you manually choose it.</li>
    <li>You choose where the file is saved (for example, local storage or cloud storage via Android’s system dialog).</li>
    <li>No automatic uploading or sharing occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The contents of the CSV file may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>App package name.</li>
    <li>Day (in a date format such as <code>ddMMyyyy</code>).</li>
    <li>Total seconds of usage for that app on that day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All usage data is stored locally on your device in the App’s private storage.</li>
    <li>No data is stored on servers controlled by HealthierTime.</li>
    <li>No data is sent to third parties.</li>
    <li>Data remains on your device until you uninstall the App or clear the App’s data.</li>
    <li>CSV exports remain wherever you saved them until you delete them manually.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>

<p>
    Floating Time Tracker does <strong>not</strong> collect or process any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your name or identity.</li>
    <li>Your email address or phone number.</li>
    <li>Your contacts.</li>
    <li>Your photos, media, or other personal files.</li>
    <li>Your precise location or GPS data.</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers.</li>
    <li>Network identifiers or IP addresses.</li>
    <li>Any content you view or create inside other apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We do not use analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or tracking libraries in Floating Time Tracker.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>

<p>
    We do not share your data with any third parties.  
    There are no third-party servers, external analytics, or advertising services integrated into Floating Time Tracker.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
    Because all processing is performed locally and no data is transmitted,
    the risk of data exposure is significantly reduced.
</p>

<p>
    However, if you export CSV files and store them in external locations (for example, cloud storage or shared folders),
    their security will depend on how you manage those locations and services.
</p>

<h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>

<p>You have full control over the App’s permissions and data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You may revoke Usage Access permission at any time in your device settings.</li>
    <li>You may revoke the “Appear on top” (overlay) permission at any time.</li>
    <li>You may clear the App’s data in system settings to remove all stored usage data.</li>
    <li>You may uninstall Floating Time Tracker at any time, which deletes all App data stored on your device.</li>
    <li>You may choose whether or not to export data to CSV files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or in legal requirements.
    When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
</p>
