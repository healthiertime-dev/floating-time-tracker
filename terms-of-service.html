<h1>Terms of Service - Floating Time Tracker</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14/12/2025</p>

<p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the mobile application
    <strong>Floating Time Tracker</strong> (“the App”), developed and provided by
    <strong>HealthierTime</strong>, an independent app developer (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.
    If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

<p>
    You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the App.
    By using the App, you confirm that you meet this requirement.
</p>

<h2>2. Use of the App</h2>

<p>
    Floating Time Tracker is a digital wellbeing tool designed to help you understand
    how much time you spend using your device and applications.
</p>

<p>You agree that you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the App only for lawful personal purposes.</li>
    <li>Not attempt to modify, reverse engineer, or interfere with the App’s functionality.</li>
    <li>Not misuse the App or use it in a way that could harm the device or impair its operation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Permissions and Functionality</h2>

<p>
    Certain features of the App require specific Android permissions, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Access</strong> - to detect foreground apps and measure app usage time.</li>
    <li><strong>Appear on Top (Overlay)</strong> - to display the floating timer bubble above other apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Foreground Service</strong> - to keep the timer accurate while your device screen is on.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    By granting these permissions, you allow the App to operate as intended.
    You may revoke permissions at any time in your device settings, though doing so may limit functionality.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Handling and Privacy</h2>

<p>
    The App processes usage information <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    We do not operate any backend servers for the App, and we do not receive your usage data.
    We do not sell your data or share it with third parties.
</p>

<p>
        Usage information that the App records can include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Daily screen-on time for your device.</li>
    <li>Lifetime accumulated screen-on time.</li>
    <li>Per-app foreground usage durations (measured while the screen is on).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This information is stored only in the App’s private storage on your device so that features
    such as statistics, graphs, time limits, warning bubbles, and CSV export can function.
    Historical per-app usage entries may be automatically deleted when they become older than
    the retention period you choose in the App’s settings (for example, 3 or 6 months).
    Lifetime totals and today’s counters reset only as described in the App (for example, at
    midnight or when you clear the App’s data).
</p>
    
<p>
    For detailed information on data processing, refer to our
    <a href="privacy-policy.html"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a>.
</p>

<h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>

<p>You are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring the accuracy of your device’s system time and settings.</li>
    <li>Maintaining control of any CSV exports or data you choose to save externally.</li>
    <li>Using the App safely and appropriately according to your needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Prohibited Uses</h2>

    <li>Use the App for monitoring other people’s devices without their consent.</li>
    <li>Use the App in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    <li>Exploit the App for commercial monitoring, surveillance, or data extraction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>
    The App is provided on an <strong>“as-is”</strong> and <strong>“as-available”</strong> basis.
    We make no warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accuracy or reliability of usage tracking.</li>

    To the fullest extent permitted by law, HealthierTime shall not be liable for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
    <li>Loss of data (including CSV exports saved outside the App).</li>
    <li>Any harm resulting from improper use or device malfunction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Updates and Changes</h2>

<p>
    We may update the App or these Terms at any time.
    Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
</p>

<p>
    Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

    We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
