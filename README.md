Floating Time Tracker: 

A privacy-focused, lightweight screen-time tracking solution for Android.

Overview: 

Floating Time Tracker is a minimal and efficient Android application designed to provide accurate, real-time insight into device usage.
The application operates entirely on-device, ensuring full user privacy, and presents usage information through a customisable floating overlay alongside detailed analytical views.

This project is developed and maintained by HealthierTime, an independent software studio committed to creating transparent, privacy-respecting digital tools.
